i am currently researching for a way to make the bot open a file so i have added a new command - ?openfile

second update: i added 2 more commands ?info and ?plug - one is stolen and the other is pretty simple

I made improvements to the ?audio command by making the number of seconds a variable decided by the user. I also made a ?hackme command that 
is used to execute bash commands on the rasbpi. For security reasons i have decided to comment it and i highly suggest deleting it if this bot
is used in a bigger server.
