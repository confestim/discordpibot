i am currently researching for a way to make the bot open a file so i have added a new command - ?openfile

second update: i added 2 more commands ?info and ?plug - one is stolen and the other is pretty simple

I made improvements to the ?audio command by making the number of seconds a variable decided by the user. I also made a ?hackme command that 
is used to execute bash commands on the rasbpi. For security reasons i have decided to comment it and i highly suggest deleting it if this bot
is used in a bigger server.

added a useless ?echo command it just repeats a thing you say (i added it to pentest it - it didn't work. Seems like discord are doing their best to protect our bot machines lmao) 
also i found im extremely dumb and while doing the ?audio and ?picture commands i added unnecesarry file paths.

added 2 passive commands - a welcoming one and a meme one. also added a new command - ?gambling(it's pretty fun) BUT it doesnt delete its messages(bc i haven't found out how yet). I also removed the ?installpre command and added a new file - installpre.sh
