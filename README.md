A Discord bot that gives you the stuff you need to know for your Raspberry Pi 3 (and other stuff too).

To run this you need to add your bot token from [Discord Developer](https://discordapp.com/developers/) to the config.py file and then execute bot.py.

To see what the commands do, see the bot.py file.

This is just a personal project of mine so don't think of it highly.
